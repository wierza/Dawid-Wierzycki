## About me

Hello! I'm Dawid.

I graduate Fullstack Developer bootcamp. I have a passion for programming and new technologies. My heart beats for JavaScript and React â€“ these technologies have allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Through the course, I have gained solid foundations in both front-end and back-end development. Now, I aim to continue my coding journey, constantly deepening my knowledge and skills. I am not afraid of challenges and always strive to excel in what I do.

I am open to collaboration and ready to participate in exciting projects that will allow me to grow as a developer. Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub and reach out for potential callaboration!
